and as the wall you like how hard is it him in the water world press down on that thing in there for hello how's that sound it would seem that the freemen wing little details like that quantitatively we can and represent really all of these these otherwise analog clock human reality is filled that the hand is really all unrealistic ways that we've been doesn't represent information again computer residential have all these different formats than than than as fancy as those devices in yours are it's just there arose in one tiny little switches were light bulbs if you will represented in some way it's up to us all for that you're not another flight to use those are the ones in ways we want to get the computers to do something more powerful and classes then on this representation of information which i dare say is i don't think we will probably fall is all about taking in information increasing moved by some process in between and questions that have that in fact so really a question there are many other file for nuts out there you would too heavy for for video in more generally views are the things called kodak's and containerized it's not quite as simple one using larger file for instance in more modern formats that the video is just the sequence of images for instance why did you stuart that many images for like a hollywood movie like twenty four or thirty of them for second that's a huge number of images if you've ever taking phone awful isn't your fault you might know how many megabytes or larger been individual photographs might be so famous and developed over the years off it's your software that is is much more math represents the same information million wade is using somehow swore patterns of zeros and ones that are most simplistic representation fear and they use what would be called contrasted vividly is that that file or something else fun how your computer refusing fewer zeros and ones to represent the same amount of information ideally without losing any information and in the world of multimedia would focus on all of it in a few weeks there are both lawsuit and lost less feel that's out there was less means you lose no information whatsoever with more commonly as you're alluding to what is lost in a compression aloe as as why we're actually throwing away some one hundred calling you getting us on the line of conciliation been lying on the comforting to mend the happens a lot simpler know what reserves distribute and in the world will pay you have containers like what time it father bought into a containers back in one different formats the video different formats of quality of the one fly off but there to do designers have discretion toward a few weeks to other questions then on information as well if all exactly in bakken it's a monthly basis in a vacuum into which is like some physically large device fond of that lived only stored some zero or wanted on yes it is the miniaturization of hard were these days that has allowed us discourse has many and many more zeros and ones what's more closely together if we build your fancy machines that these are the following this already been smaller scale we're just happy meal you look into these devices but there are two is a trial for instance you might know by using your phone off or your laptop for quite awhile may be on your lap starts to get me on and so there there is little physical five effects of this for now sober devices were on houghton is his wife with ideas center in the real world might need more care punishing minutes of all places because there are these physical artifacts as well and effective in like to see what he probably is computers for decades ago across the river syria allstate unit engineering building is the hormone market one computer on bed will get you home much big government lot of just that's full of income that have this first picture the computer science or renewed calls all the ideas that we have me on what is now to represent information input and output long as we all just agree on something and thankfully all of those before us and given the things like asking a new code at the budget and forced more documents and why what's inside of this poor little black box in someone's these infants are going out with your comment or platform and this time in reference to an algorithm which is just step by step instructions for solving some problem incarnate in the world of computers by software when you write software eighty eight programs york implementing water more algorithms one or more step process of instructions for solving some problem and maybe you're using this language or that the d. n. a. don't matter of the language you use the computer scanner represent what you typed using just zeros and ones so what idea of representative algorithm nowadays you might use on your phone quite a bit that may call sir said ten thirty miles an hour free of all what the contacts in your addressable nowadays of course is a very good
